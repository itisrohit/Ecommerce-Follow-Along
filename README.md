# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

This one is applied. Mernify, let us call it this way-a project of e-commerce development through MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Full-stack development lessons are included because we are going to practice with authentication, build RESTful APIs, and develop a scalable application.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

### Key Points:
1. **What Is MERN?**  
   - A technology stack based on Javascript that is very highly used for creating a full-stack application.
   - Development can be streamlined further by utilizing only one language throughout the frontend and backend.

2. **REST API Structure and Endpoints**
   - Introduction to API paradigm designing-learn how to create endpoints for user authentication, product management, and order conciliation; define API design principles; associate endpoints with databases and describe how JSON is served to the client.

3. **Database Schema Design Basics**  
   - Creation of structured data models with MongoDB.
   - Learning relationships and schema optimization.

4. **Why Authentication?**  
   - A secure login with registration is required to secure the user and any sensitive data.
   - It will help in verifying the users identity and verify access to its resources.

5. **Live Demonstration**  
   - They saw a functioning example of an entire e-commerce application.
   - The main features of the application include product browsing, adding and setting the cart, and the transaction part.

This milestone will help you understand the kind of structure and core features that would make your e-commerce application robust.

## Next Steps
On the leading edge, next steps should ideally include:
1. Prepare the development environment and install the required tools.
2. Explore the server-client protocol and complete a small server in Node.js and Express.
3. Deliver this database design and development in building ghost APIs.

Stay tuned for more exciting developments! ðŸš€
